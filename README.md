### 👋 Hi, I’m Zeph Wyne

I’m a computer programming student from the Philippines 🇵🇭  
I enjoy figuring out how things work — whether it’s code, design, or random ideas that pop up at 2 AM.  

I’m constantly learning and experimenting with different technologies.  
Right now, I’m focused on improving my **Phython**, **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **MySQL** skills —  
and exploring **.NET**, **Web development**, and other fun side projects that keep me curious.

### 💬 About Me

Outside programming, I enjoy editing videos/photos, writing, and creating stuff that  
blends logic with imagination. I believe ideas don’t have to make perfect sense —  
they just need to start somewhere.
