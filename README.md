### 👋 Hi, I’m Zeph Wyne

I’m a computer programming student from the Philippines 🇵🇭  
I enjoy figuring out how things work — whether it’s code, design, or random ideas that pop up at 2 AM.  

I’m constantly learning and experimenting with different technologies.  
Right now, I’m focused on improving my **Phython**, **Java**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **MySQL** skills —  
and exploring **.NET**, **Web development**, and other fun side projects that keep me curious.

### ⚙️ What I’m Into
- 💻 Building small projects to practice and learn 
- 🌐 Designing simple but functional websites 
- 🧠 Mixing logic with creativity — because code can be art too  

---

### ⚡ Fun Facts
- Can go from talking about programming to philosophy in 0.3 seconds  
- 90% coding, 10% Googling errors I caused myself  
- My playlists range from lo-fi to boss battle music  
- I once debugged for hours just to realize I missed a semicolon 😅

### 🧰 Tech & Tools
**Languages:** `Phyton`, `Java`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `PHP`, `SQL` 
**Tools:** `NetBeans`, `VS Code`, `Eclipse`, `phpMyAdmin`, `MySQL Workbench`  
**Currently Learning:** `.NET`

### 💬 About Me
I’m a curious ENTP who loves learning new things — from coding and design  
to psychology, creativity, and how people think.  

Outside programming, I enjoy editing videos/photos, writing, and creating stuff that  
blends logic with imagination. I believe ideas don’t have to make perfect sense —  
they just need to start somewhere.
